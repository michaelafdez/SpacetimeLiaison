P: But alas! I imagine they’re still hidden about, spying on my every move even when I order them not to. 
(it’d be funny if his servants were hiding poorly behind different props in the environment)
Y: Yikes, that sounds annoying.
P: Well yes, I suppose they can be quite annoying, but they don’t know any better.
P: They’re part of a…I believe the term would be “lesser” species. 
P: You see, they’re prisoners of war from the nation of Friendliness that my father had hypnotized and enslaved. 
P: So their ignorance really isn’t their fault. 
Y: The nation of…Friendliness?
P: Ah, I recognize that look in your face. 
P: You’re worried that the Friendly people are innocent and my father is committing these atrocities for no reason.
P: Well I assure you they are not. Innocent, that is.
P: The Janicula empire has been at war with the Friendly people for generations. 
P: They dared to secede from our perfect nation. Even, might I add, under the outstanding ruling of my great great great great great grandfather! Horatio!
P: Can you imagine?
Y: If they saw your nation now, they’d come crawling back. 
P: I’m glad you believe so. We work tirelessly in our quest for greatness.
P: My father even plans to develop a modified version of our monarchy. He wants to incorporate something called a Parliament. 
P: Anyways, I tire of speaking on political matters. 
P: What else would you like to talk about? 
Y: Tell me about yourself. 
P: Well, since you insist.
P: On my leisure, I enjoy taking long horse rides through the plains. 
P: Occasionally, I enjoy visiting the royal dungeon and choosing which traitor will be next to be executed.
P: Recently, I’ve also been learning to crochet. It’s very therapeutic. 
Y: I’m sure you go through a lot of stress.
P: You wouldn’t even begin to understand the amount of pressure I’m put through.  
P: Believe it or not, I long to live in a society where I can just sit down and eat dinner with a peasant like you. 
P: I know that, on the surface, I seem to obsessively indulge in formalities and overt egotism. 
P: And, internally, I also obsessively indulge in formalities and overt egotism. 
P: But eating with you has made me realize something important. 
P: Love can bloom between anyone, even a peasant and a handsome prince.
P: That is, as long as both people can finish their meals by the end of a date. Otherwise, why bother?
P:
